v2.0.0 (xx Aug 2013)
	Complete code revision and refactor.
	The module is renamed to "binary-reader".
	The DataReader class is removed. If you want to read lines use another module,
		for example, a transform stream:
		http://blog.strongloop.com/practical-examples-of-the-new-node-js-streams-api/
	A synchronous api but asynchronous execution has been added.
	"skip()" has been removed. Use "seek()" with an offset from the current
		position.
	"getOffset()" has been renamed to "tell()".
	"seek()" now accepts a "whence" parameter describing from where is referenced
		the offset.
	Added "size()".
	"isOffsetOutOfWindow()" has been refactored and renamed to "isEOF()".

v1.0.0 (04 Oct 2012)
	Complete code refactor for better maintenance.
	New classes "DataReader" and "BinaryReader". The "BufferedReader" class has
		been deprecated.
	Added new functions to "BinaryReader": "getOffset()" and
		"isOffsetOutOfWindow()".
	The "skip" function can move the offset backwards; a negative number of bytes
		can be skipped.
	Added constants to move the offset to the start and end of window:
		"BinaryReader.START_OF_WINDOW", "BinaryReader.END_OF_WINDOW".
	Added new setting to the "BinaryReader" constructor: "fromEnd".
	Some bug fixes.

v0.2.7 (17 Aug 2012)
	Updated errno-codes module.

v0.2.6 (05 Aug 2012)
	Better error management.

v0.2.5 (25 Jul 2012)
	The buffered reader is closed automatically on error. There's no need to
		close it again from outside.

v0.2.4 (25 Jul 2012)
	Fixed the byte offset in the "buffer" event when only a "buffer" event was
		set.
	Fixed the last byte offset of any data event. Now the last byte offset is -1.
	Added "pause()" and "resume()".

v0.2.3 (16 May 2012)
	Improved "read()" performance when the line event is not configured.

v0.2.2 (13 May 2012)
	Added a "byteOffset" parameter to the callback of emitted "byte", "character",
		"line" and "buffer" events.

v0.2.1 (13 May 2012)
	Improved "read()" performance.

v0.2.0 (02 May 2012)
	Fixed some bugs when the buffer had the same or less size than the bytes to
		read.
	Now the constructor receives an object in literal notation for the settings.
	Added start and end offsets parameters for limitting the range of the read.
	Added a "seek()" function for moving the file cursor for the next reading
		operation.
	Improved "skip()" performance. Now it calls to "seek()" function with the
		appropriate offset instead of reading the content into the buffer trying
		to simulate a jump.

v0.1.2 (29 Apr 2012)
	Added "skip()" function to skip bytes.

v0.1.1 (25 Apr 2012)
	Added "interrupt()" function to stop the file reading started with "read()".

v0.1.0 (25 Apr 2012)
	New feature. Now it's possible to read a chunk of bytes using internal
		buffers.

v0.0.6 (21 Apr 2012)
	Changed the way the module is required. Now can be required using
		"var BufferedReader = require ("buffered-reader");"

v0.0.5 (16 Apr 2012)
	Removed "getFileName()" internal function.

v0.0.4 (12 Apr 2012)
	"read()" can be called multiple times with the same "BufferedReader" instance.

v0.0.3 (11 Apr 2012)
	Fixed bug with Windows end of lines.

v0.0.2 (11 Apr 2012)
	First commit.
